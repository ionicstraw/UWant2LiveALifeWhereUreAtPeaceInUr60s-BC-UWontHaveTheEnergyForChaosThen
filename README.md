# UWant2LiveALifeWhereUreAtPeaceInUr60s-BC-UWontHaveTheEnergyForChaosThen

im going to sit down and lecture u on this one day but for now, and only once i'll do that, but for now, archiving this

fine ill do it now. 

the person ure with, does not have the ability to raise ur kid the way u want them to turn out -- that person is going to say "yes" to everything, looks like a random push-over to me.

to do well in STEM, u have to say "no" to a lot of things and have serious self confidence etc. theres so much more to it

u may have a situation where ur kid is running around, when ure in ur 60s, slamming doors, talking back to u and so much more, so much more that u dont even understand yet.

im not saying i want that for u, but i know what that's all about.

u wont have the energy to handle that when ure older, its going to be incredible heartbreak for u, so u figure that out now so things dont turn out that way for u (e.g. dont do/say anything stupid, listen to ur lawyer)

theres so much more i want to say but i dont want to go there now

ure an arrogant control freak, ppl r going to catch on to that quickly, esp in court, ure not going to get what u want by being that either and ure going to wear yourself out if ure going to be an arrogant control freak throughout this whole thing just fyi

ure going to learn from my dad how he managed his life **so well** so that he's at peace in his 60s. my dad leads by example (he has his sh*t together 100% of the time), is a forgiving person and doesnt highlight someone's faults or embarass ppl in front of other ppl --- its all psychology/emotional intelligence, people managing --- u have to bring this same thing into n o m i a l , u cant be an arrogant control freak there either and im not saying u r all the time, its not a good thing to be all the time bc thats going to wear u out too

do u get what im saying, i dont want u fighting via phone calls/txt messages while ure co-parenting bc ure going to be an **arrogant control freak.** u have to **maintain the peace and get the outcome u want.** that involves emotional intelligence and patience etc. i dont want to be in the middle of this, if u decide to handle things this way, im serious, i dont like fighting.

whats going to make u even more arrogant, have u figured it out? me. "ohh i/we would have handled this situation better than u (u = ure ex-partner)" -> and then there would be fightingn back and forth, so u cant compare partner a with partner b, that's stupid. u have to manage all of this bc i dont want to be in the middle of chaos. u have to manage ur arrogance.
