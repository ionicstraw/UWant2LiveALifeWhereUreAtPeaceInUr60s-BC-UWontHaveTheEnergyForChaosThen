# UWant2LiveALifeWhereUreAtPeaceInUr60s-BC-UWontHaveTheEnergyForChaosThen

im going to sit down and lecture u on this one day but for now, and only once i'll do that, but for now, archiving this

fine ill do it now. 

the person ure with, does not have the ability to raise ur kid the way u want them to turn out -- that person is going to say "yes" to everything, looks like a random push-over to me.

to do well in STEM, u have to say "no" to a lot of things and have serious self confidence etc. theres so much more to it

u may have a situation where ur kid is running around, when ure in ur 60s, slamming doors, talking back to u and so much more, so much more that u dont even understand yet.

im not saying i want that for u, but i know what that's all about.

u wont have the energy to handle that when ure older, its going to be incredible heartbreak for u, so u figure that out now so things dont turn out that way for u (e.g. dont do/say anything stupid, listen to ur lawyer)

theres so much more i want to say but i dont want to go there now

ure an arrogant control freak, ppl r going to catch on to that quickly, esp in court, ure not going to get what u want by being that either and ure going to wear yourself out if ure going to be an arrogant control freak throughout this whole thing just fyi
